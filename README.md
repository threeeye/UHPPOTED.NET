# UHPPOTED.NET
This is a Server/Client UDP application for access control systems based on the UHPPOTE UT0311-L0x TCP/IP Wiegand access control boards.
This is a work in progress and developped out of GitHub (this repository will not get updated ATM)
Thanks to the awesome work of [uhppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted) in providing a .NET API (https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-dll)
I have now a working concept
